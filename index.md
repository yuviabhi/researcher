<br /><br />

Hi!  I’m **Abhisek Chowdhury**  <br /> <br />A Project Officer (IT) at National Digital Library (NDL) , IIT Kharagpur.



<br /><br /><br /><br />



## Research Interest

---

I work in the field of **'Disaster Management specifically Flood using Social Media'** where analysing the Twitter texts is an important objective for sentiment analysis to filter out the real-world flood tweets using SVM and other classifiers and also location extraction from raw tweets using NLP technics is a real challenge since most of the tweets lacks the geo-tags in India. And finally identifying the flood affected regions in India (State of Bihar as a case study) from tweets and other auxiliary data sets (eg. Satellite data, rainfall, water-bodies etc) with a probabilistic unsupervised model developed using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs).
