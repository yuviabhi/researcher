<br /><br />

### Hi!  I’m **Abhisek Chowdhury**  
<br /> <br />
A Ph.D. Research Scholar at IIT Kharagpur under guidance of Prof. Ram Babu Roy & Prof. Partha Pratim Das, IIT Kharagpur. 
<br /> <br />
I also work as a Project Officer (IT) at National Digital Library (NDL) , IIT Kharagpur .



<br /><br /><br /><br />

## Current Research Interest
---
Currently I am interested in the field of **'Healthcare Analytics'** by automatically detecting human activities and behavior for personalized preventive care.

<br /><br />

## Previous Research Interest

---

I worked in the field of **'Disaster Management specifically Flood using Social Media'** where analyzing the raw tweets was an important objective for classification of real-world flood and non-flood tweets using SVM and other classifiers and also location extraction from twitter text using NLP and Information retrieval mechanisms was a real challenge since most of the tweets lacked the geo-tags in India. And finally developed a novel probabilistic unsupervised model with Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) for identification of flood affected regions in India (State of Bihar as a case study) in real-time with the help of auxiliary data sets (eg. Satellite data, rainfall, water-bodies etc).
